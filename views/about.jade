            h1 PolyRhythm - About
            p.
                When PolyRhythm is in it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGdFXUJ1o1U">final form</a>
                it will be a way for artists to create visual effects that are connected with sockets and midi
                controllers. PolyRhythm will work with existing midi controllers and music software such as
                    <a href="https://www.ableton.com/" target="_blank">Ableton Live</a> and
                    <a href="http://www.apple.com/logic-pro/">Logic</a>.
            p.
                PolyRhythm is currently undergoing some heavey refactoring because
                we thought that we could build it better. If your curious you can
                checkout our <a href="/status">status page</a>
                for more info on our plans.
        
            p. 
                PolyRhythm started as a project at the 2016 SXSW Music hackathon.
                It is our hope that we will be able use PolyRhythm in order to make 
                really awesome visual performances, and change the way (slightly) 
                how people play music. and compose audio visual performances.
